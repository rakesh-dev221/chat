    Descriptions: To begin the SPF Volunteer Recruitment Drive 2021, we helped produce a profile series titled Stories Untold, featuring different police volunteers in their respective roles while discussing their motivation and journey of being part of the Singapore Police Force.

We often come across police officers patrolling around our neighborhoods, parks, or even shopping centers. However, who exactly are they, and what exactly are their responsibilities?

By producing a profile series of the Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) (Community) officers, it has provided a platform for the officers to share their motivations behind signing up as SPF volunteers. This has also allowed for a more in-depth understanding of their role and the challenges and difficulties they faced within their job.

The videos introduced the SPF Volunteer Recruitment 2021, encouraging more to sign up as volunteers to create their own stories within SPF.

    Descriptions: To begin the SPF Volunteer Recruitment Drive 2021, we helped produce a profile series titled Stories Untold, featuring different police volunteers in their respective roles while discussing their motivation and journey of being part of the Singapore Police Force.

We often come across police officers patrolling around our neighborhoods, parks, or even shopping centers. However, who exactly are they, and what exactly are their responsibilities?

By producing a profile series of the Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) (Community) officers, it has provided a platform for the officers to share their motivations behind signing up as SPF volunteers. This has also allowed for a more in-depth understanding of their role and the challenges and difficulties they faced within their job.

The videos introduced the SPF Volunteer Recruitment 2021, encouraging more to sign up as volunteers to create their own stories within SPF.

    Descriptions: In this digital age, we often neglect the things most important to us. We were commissioned by Hasbro to come up with a seasonal video advertisement which asked families to rethink their priorities, to lay down their devices and #playtogether as a family.

Our concept seamlessly integrates Hasbro's featured toys—NERF, Monopoly, and Play-Doh—into a heartwarming short that emphasises the importance of familial bonds through the eyes of a little girl. We also delivered a video cutdown and produced versions in different languages catering to audiences from the APAC region such as Taiwan and Thailand. The videos have since racked up over a million total views on Hasbro's social media platforms.

    Descriptions: As generations pass, the significance of some traditions inadvertently fade with time. The Chinese believe that the gifting of gold ornaments during the leap month is a form of blessing to their elders, an act that signifies filial piety and a wish for their happiness and longevity. This custom is weaved into a stirring tale of the special bond between a little boy and his beloved grandmother.

 

Although our loved ones may not always remain by our side, the memories made and bonds forged will always remain precious and enduring. We mirror this sentiment with the traditional practice, incorporating an animated storytelling element that speaks to the rich culture of Chinese mythology. This compelling short film builds on On Cheong Jewellery’s tagline: Crafted by time, Cherished for generations.

    Descriptions: What does it mean to be a hero?

Commissioned by Club Rainbow (Singapore), the videos feature the winners of the annual Exemplary Caregivers’ Award. We weave together profiles of the awardees, celebrating their selfless love for and tireless dedication to the children under their care who suffer from chronic illnesses. With candid interviews and B-roll footage of their daily lives, greater insight is given into the challenges that caregivers have to continually surmount and their hopes for the future—bearing testament to the fact that anyone can be a hero.

    Descriptions: Riding the wave of heightened emotions stirred up by the World Cup, this advertisement encapsulates the passion felt for the sport and the strong sense of camaraderie among football players. As soundbites highlight the dedication and values held by players, visuals capture the fervent emotions, friendships forged, and spirit of sportsmanship characteristic of the beautiful game. Worn out after a lively match, the team enjoys a hearty McDonald’s meal together—drawing the video to a close as the same sense of connectedness is tied to McDelivery® Singapore’s 24/7 delivery service.

    Descriptions: Think beyond the surface with The Unlimited. Spot cleaners are lightweight, cordless, and easy to lift and manoeuvre—but how can The Unlimited be set apart from its competitors? By creating the world’s first 3D vacuum sculpture.

Commissioned by Bosch to showcase their new Unlimited Spot Cleaner, we featured visual artist Andy Yang as he meticulously works through a dense mass of cotton wool to carve out a stunning representation of a tree. Sweeping visuals of the artist at work translate into a tone that inspires bold creativity, while the unconventional use of the vacuum cleaner captures the product’s precision and versatility in a truly unique piece of art.
